as a call receiver, is availability on demand or preconfigured?

	think of you call a friend because you got such suggestion and he/she is busy. he/she tells you to call him/her back later. does this suggestion go to the end of the queue? does this receiver have a chance to open availability windowns on the app?

ressaldo, as feedback from Pietro for the report

is the SL card transferable? yes
the app should not maybe participate on any transaction and just facilitate the contact.
what if (as mentioned in the proposals session) someone buys/sells a card, and then that card gets reported as stolen or lost by the previous owner so that the card is not usable anymore?
